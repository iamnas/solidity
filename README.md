abicoder.sol 

In this code i am using >>pragma abicoder v2; liberary
using this liberary we can pass struct element as a parameter 
now in latest version (0.8.0 above ) we can pass struct element as a parameter without using this liberary 

["username","address"] eg. = ["user_name","0xAC01140De7C34bCE3Ed346b81428E7D07E8F3A9A"]



 
- we can create deployed address again
-
